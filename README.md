# LockSmith
A simple Python (and Executable Windows) program that generates high entropy, cryptographically secure passwords 64 characters long.

There is a Python file and a Windows executable file. It's very easy to use, just open it, move your mouse on the rectangle below the 3 password fields to add entropy, then press the freeze button.

Simple as that!
